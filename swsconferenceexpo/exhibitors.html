Over time, concrete, brick, and metal lines deteriorate, which causes leaks and cave-ins. These lines can be repaired from inside the pipe by lining the pipe with steel mesh or rebar and spraying the surface with multiple inches of Gunite. The finished job restores the structural integrity of the pipe for decades of future use. Because conventional excavation is not required, National Gunite can rehabilitate lines at a fraction of the cost of installing new pipe.</p>

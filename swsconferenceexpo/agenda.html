              Many storm water programs grapple with a shortage of resources that strain their ability to comply with the basic demands of the Clean Water Act, let alone implement progressive policies or programs. This presentation will explore the common barriers and pitfalls many programs encounter that all too often lead to outdated, poorly crafted or nonexistent storm water policies and processes. Examples of successful approaches as well as potential solutions to common issues will also be presented. </td>

                The Village of Northbrook’s Wescott Park project creatively combines green infrastructure with large-scale flood mitigation by utilizing a storm water storage facility and a rainwater harvesting system uses the stored water to irrigate the park’s ball fields. Topics covered will include storm water detention facility design considerations and leveraging real-time monitoring and weather forecast data in a rainwater harvesting system to provide dual-use storage volume.

                This presentation will focus on an existing detention pond that was cited with a notice of violation for lack of maintenance in 2013. A creative solution to redesign the pond was developed that included modification of the outlet structure and adding a skimmer as part of the permanent outlet in order to reduce clogging and the related maintenance costs, while also increasing water quality and sediment trapping efficiency of the BMP.

                Public beaches on the eastern shore of Lake Erie are regularly closed to bathing during the summer after moderate rain events due to water quality issues. A team worked through the New York State Environmental Protection Fund to design green infrastructure features at two municipally owned and operated public beaches with a history of beach closures, with the intent to implement small-scale practices that take a step toward addressing water quality issues.

                <em>Presenter(s): Kelly Kuhbander, Strand Associates, Inc.</em><br>
                Storm water management is becoming increasingly complex as communities face diverse challenges associated with flooding, hydromodification, and water quality.  As high intensity, short duration storms become more frequent, development continues to generate more runoff, and protecting water quality is in the spotlight - storm water master planning has become critically important.  Storm water management today involves and more complex considerations, but is still rooted in common sense storm water engineering principles. This presentation includes case study examples.

                Space to Grow is a public-private partnership that transforms Chicago schoolyards into spaces that provide students, their families and the broader community with the opportunity for active play, space for physical education, and opportunities for outdoor learning, gardening and environmental literacy while also addressing the city’s effective management of storm water. Participants in this session will hear from the partners who manage and implement this program and learn about the many benefits of green schoolyards and how they are keeping water out of the region’s sewer system.

Projects to reduce peak inflow into the creek, reduce sediment loads and nutrient pollutant loads, and improve in-stream habitat will be discussed in the context of how they contribute to improving the health of the creek and its eventual removal from the Impaired Waters List. The presentation also will discuss how a good plan can be leveraged to develop small individual projects that achieve the larger environmental goals of a watershed protection plan.

By reducing the strain on our natural infrastructure (streams and rivers), with one solution being the utilization of newer technologies such as green infrastructure or distributed controls, we can help these critical resources rebound faster and provide the resiliency needed to be less impacted by the larger events, such as the 100-year event.

                 Today, Low Impact Development (LID) regulations are pushing for advanced water management technology that will preserve environmental quality and mimic the pre‐development watershed hydrology of the site. Additionally, since water management is the primary goal, members of the design community are searching for ways to produce cost-effective Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI), including their maintenance costs while maximizing developable land. Permeable, Pervious, and Porous surfaces (the 3‐Ps) are “words that have been used interchangeably,” without regard to their unique characteristics and for that reason, have somewhat confused our industry.

                In 2015, Coventry Township, Ohio, was faced with the problem of localized flooding and poor water quality within a residential area that contained an underutilized recreational park. A network of storm sewers within the park were partially responsible for the flooding and poor water quality.  This presentation will illustrate how community leaders had the vision to redesign the park by removing 1,100 ft of buried storm sewer and adding a natural stream channel and riparian corridor on the property. By redesigning the park, the township was able to reduce flooding, educate the community about the benefits of natural storm water management techniques, improve water quality, and create a wider variety of recreational opportunities for the residents in the community.

                Whether they go gray or green, storm water infrastructure repairs are no longer a luxury for many communities; they are a necessity to reduce chronic flooding and improve impaired rivers and streams—especially as climate change exacerbates existing problems. Communities need to repair old systems and build new, modern systems that embrace technological advances, but communities also need money to do it. A storm water utility is an equitable way for communities to raise some of the money they need to fix the most immediate storm water problems.

With only 10 to 12 in. of cover between the crown and the busy road above, the structural integrity of the rehabilitation is imperative. Live load testing, with a semi-tractor pulling a flatbed trailer weighing a total of 83,620 lb, was used to confirm structural integrity and to ensure the bridge’s capability to withstand its rated load.

                <em>Presenter(s): Brett Holmes, P.E., StormTrap</em><br>
                Industrial sites are facing many challenges today when trying to meet the strict regulations on flow attenuation and treatment requirements. This presentation focuses on three sites that had unique goals due to their industrial applications and the innovative storm water management solutions that were put in place to overcome the challenges.

                The responsibility of managing, implementing and documenting NPDES MS4 permit activities can be overwhelming. MS4 permittees are finding it more and more difficult to identify individuals within their organization who can handle the numerous tasks involved. The presentation will demonstrate tools a permittee can use to manage his or her program with one or more individuals.

                MS4 permittees are often blamed for pollution problems in waterbodies where they are discharging and face steep fines. Permittees can use results of microbial source tracking (MST) analysis as evidence they are in compliance with their permits. The presentation will detail lessons learned and outcomes achieved from two MST projects, as well as evidence-based guidance on crafting an effective MST plan.

                The Brahmaputra River is one of the largest rivers in the world, with millions of lives relying on it for agricultural and marine farming. However, there is a constant change in the channel morphology and the course of the river, with erosion along the banks and formation of bars and islands in the river. This work inspects the geotechnical behavior of the soil and proposes a new methodology for the scour process based on field investigation, as well as possible remediation measures for this problem.
